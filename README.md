# RaspberryPiDoor
This code was slightly modified for the project because the servo I was using was a different kind, however, because I believe most people have the type of servo used by the Adafruit tutorial I found this code at
(https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-face-recognition-treasure-box/software)
I have just kept the original. 
Also, the original was for a treasure box, but I just made it a facial recognition door for the project instead.
